Thinking is Identifications. Thinking is necessary in order to know what you are looking at. When you know what you are looking at, then you can act in accord with the laws of nature. Acting in accord with the laws of nature, a things identity, allows you to build, create and make the items necessary to live. Not acting according the laws of nature by committing mental evasion of the need to think, of the need to identify, results in fraud, theft and physical force.  So choosing to think or not to think is choosing life or death. If you choose to think, then you have right to defend you integrity/identity from those who choose not to think, to defend your identify from their evasion of identity by their fraud, theft and initiation of force.
