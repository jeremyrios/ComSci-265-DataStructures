// Program Description: 
//  Program accepts a user defined year then determines if entry is a leap year.
// Note:
//  A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4 and not by 100 or, a
//  year that is evenly divisible by 400.

  // remainder100 = the remainder after the user defined year is divided by 100.
  // remainder400 = the remainder after the user defined year is divided by 400.
