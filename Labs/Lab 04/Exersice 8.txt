
Qestion 1
      Templates help in code reuse by eliminating the need to create 
    multiple funtions that do the same thing but are able to handle 
    different data types.

Question 2
      Because because the compiler automatically generates code for 
    each new type that is required, if there is a subtle error in the template 
    it coudle potentially spiderweb errors througout your code.

question 3
      It names the functions by combining the identifier and the tpye

Question 4
      Reference parameters work by pointing to the address where the parameter data is contained.
